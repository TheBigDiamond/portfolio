# My Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This simple website showcases my projects, skills, and experiences in the world of programming. Here you can find all my works with also a small description of each one, along with links to the actual live demo.

## The structure of the project
This portfolio is composed of 3 pages. We have the "About" page, which features my CV, containing my education, skills and past work experiences. Then, we have the "Projects" page, 
which presents all the projects i have made in my path in this field.

Last but not least, the "Contact me" page, which contains a simple form that can be used to contact me directly through the EmailJS service.
All of the project has been stylized with SASS.
