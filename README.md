# My Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects, skills, and experiences in the world of programming. Here you can find all my works with also a small description of each one.

## The structure of the project
This portfolio is composed of 3 pages. We have the "About" page, which features my CV, containing my education, skills and past work experiences. Then, we have the "Projects" page, 
which presents all the projects i have made in my path in this magnificent world, with a screenshot for every important part in the project. 
Last but not least, the "Contact me" page, which contains a simple form that can be used to contact me directly (although at the moment it is not working) through the EmailJS service.
All of the project has been stylized with SASS.
